# ReBasic
ReBasic is an IDE for the [TI 83 and 84 graphing calculator programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-BASIC).
With ReBasic, it is easy to create and edit programs that would be cumbersome on the calculators.
It is able to open from and export to .8xp files which can then be loaded to and from a calculator via link cable.

This is very much a work in progress, so feedback and help are welcome!

## Screenshots
Please imagine the most hideous interface that you can so I can blow your expectations out of the water when I actually get around to posting something here.

## Download
There are currently no builds of ReBasic, but you can compile it yourself with [Processing](https://processing.org/).
So far, ReBasic has only been tested on Windows and may not fully function on Mac / Linux.
